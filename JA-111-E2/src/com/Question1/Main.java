/*	
	***IS-A relationship*** -> If a class B Extents from class A it mean's class B is the child class of Parent class A, so 
						the relation between class A and class B is "IS-A" relationship. Class B "IS-A" child of 
						class Class A.
	
 Example --> 
	
 Class A{ 
	
		Void eat() {
		
		System.out.println("Eating food");
	
	}
	
}

class B extends A{

	B b = new b()
	b.eat();
	
	}
		

	
***Has-A Relationship*** --> If any parent class hold the it's child class is called as "Has-A" relationship.
						for Example - > If a parent class created with the name Car and inside this Car a new class 
						created named Engine and we write some method in it this type of relation called "Has-A" 
						relationship.
						
						
	class Car{
	
					System.out.println("I am inside Car class);
					
			class Engine{
			
					System.out.println ("I am inside Engine class);
					
					}
					
	}
	
***Access Modifier*** --> In java there are total 4 type  of Modifier available.	
							
		1) Public --> Public modifier can be accessible inside the class and Outside the class also it can be
					  accessible inside the packages and outside the packages in java.
					  
		2) Private --> Private modifier only accessible inside of its class only,it's not available even for same 
		 			   Same package class.
		
		3) Protected --> Protected Modifier can be accessible inside the same package classes, but not accessible in
		   			   	 different Packages.
		
		4) Default --> Default Modifier are those modifier that if we not write any type of modifier in front of any method 
		   			   variable, class and method are called Default Modifier and we can access it like Public modifier.
